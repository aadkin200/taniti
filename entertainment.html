        Entertainment: <br />Most people visit Taniti to enjoy the beaches,
        explore the rainforest, and to visit the volcano. However, there are
        other things to do, including visiting a local history museum, going on
        chartered fishing tours, snorkeling, zip-lining in the rainforest,
        visiting several pubs, including a microbrewery, dancing at a new dance
        club, seeing a movie, taking helicopter rides, playing at an arcade,
        visiting art galleries, and bowling. Also, a nine-hole golf course
        should be operational by next year. Many of these activities are located
        in Merriton Landing, which is a rapidly developing area on the north
        side of Yellow Leaf Bay.
