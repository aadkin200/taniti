        between the hours of midnight and 9:00 a.m. The drinking age on Taniti
        is 18 and the drinking age is not strictly enforced. Many younger
        Tanitians speak fluent English. Very little English is spoken in rural
        areas, especially by the older residents. There is one hospital and
        several clinics. The hospital has many multilingual employees. Violent
        crime is very rare on Taniti, but as tourism increases, there are more
        reports of pickpocketing and other petty crimes. Taniti enjoys a large
        number of national holidays, and many tourist attractions and
        restaurants will be closed on holidays, so visitors should plan
        accordingly. Taniti uses the U.S. dollar as its currency, but many
        businesses will also accept euros and yen. Several banks facilitate
        currency exchange, and many businesses accept major credit cards.
