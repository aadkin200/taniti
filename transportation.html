        Transportation: Almost all visitors arrive to Taniti by air, though some
        arrive on a small cruise ship that docks in Yellow Leaf Bay for one
        night per week. Taniti is served by a small airport that can accommodate
        small jets and propeller planes. Taniti is in the process of expanding
        the airport so larger jets will be able to land on the island within the
        next few years. Ground Transportation: Public buses serve Taniti City
        and run from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. every day. Private buses serve the rest
        of the island. Taxis are available in Taniti City, and rental cars can
        be rented from a local rental agency near the airport. Bikes and helmets
        are available to rent from several vendors (helmets are required by
        law). Taniti City is fairly flat and very walkable. Many tourists stay
        in the area surrounding Merriton Landing: this area is easy to explore
        on foot.
